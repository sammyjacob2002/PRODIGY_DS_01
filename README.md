Task 1 - Create bar chart to visualize the distribution of a categorical and continuous variable on Billionaires Statistics Dataset.

Final Worth by Gender:

The pie chart shows the distribution of final worth based on gender.
It has two segments: one for males (labeled 'M') and another for females (labeled 'F').
The chart visually represents the relative worth attributed to each gender.
Final Worth by Category:

The bar graph displays final worth categorized by different categories.
Categories are shown on the horizontal axis, and their corresponding worth values are on the vertical axis.
This chart provides insights into how worth varies across different categories.
Final Worth by First Name:

The second bar graph represents final worth based on first names.
Each first name is plotted along the horizontal axis, and its associated worth value is shown on the vertical axis.
Analyzing this chart can reveal patterns related to first names and their worth.
Final worth by regionwise:

Visualize the final worth based on regions.
Overall, these visualizations help understand the distribution of final worth based on gender, category, and first names.
